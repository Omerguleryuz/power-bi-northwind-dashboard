## Northwind Power BI Dashboard

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the Northwind Company dataset. The goal was to extract strategic insights that could improve the companyâ€™s operational efficiency, and profitability. I employed Power BI to analyze and visualize the data.

Overall KPIs:
I evaluated key performance indicators (KPIs) including Total Orders, Gross Sales, Total Quantity Sold, On Time Orders %, Employee Performances, etc.
These metrics helped in summarizing the company's overall performance, giving a top-down view of the general situation.

Customer and Product Category Analysis:
I analyzed employee data to determine the top 10 employees by order value. I also identified the best-selling product categories and visualized the sales distribution across product categories like Beverages, Dairy Products, and Confections.

Regional Analysis:
In this part, I only focused on total orders by shipping countries. I have prepared a world map and visualized the number of orders. 

Customer Analysis:
Finally, I focused on customer metrics. Key performance indicators (KPIs) include revenue per customer, total customers by continent, and the number of loyal customers. This page enables analysis of customer numbers and provides insights into average earnings per customer.
